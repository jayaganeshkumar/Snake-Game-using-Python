# Snake-Game-using-Python
<br>
It is the game which many people are used to play before we have the smartphones.
<br>
I used python to design this game. The library pygame is very helpful in designing games like this.
<br>
This game is controlled with a,w,s,d keys in keyboard.
<br>
a -> left
<br>
w -> up
<br>
s -> bottom
<br>
d -> right

#### Clone or download the repository and just run the snake.exe file to enjoy the game.
Hope you enjoy playing this game.

### Thank you
